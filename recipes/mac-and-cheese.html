    <h1>Mac and Cheese</h1>
    <img src="../images/Macandcheese.jpg" alt="Delicious Mac and cheese"

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>As I looked over recipes for homemade macaroni and cheese, I determined that there were two distinct styles of preparation. The more common variety is béchamel-based, where macaroni is blanketed with a cheese-flavored white sauce, usually topped with crumbs and baked. The other variety, the kind my mother always made, is custard-based. In this version, a mixture of egg and milk is poured over layers of grated cheese and noodles. As the dish bakes, the egg, milk and cheese set into a custard. This recipe is also topped with bread crumbs and baked, although my mom sprinkled crushed saltine crackers over hers.</p>
    <p>Although I was in the béchamel-style camp, I couldn't remember the last time I had made a truly exceptional macaroni and cheese. After a few initial tests, I understood why. Most recipes seemed tired, leaden and uninspired. Others attempted to perk up the dish with silly additions like canned green chilies or black olives. And of course, there were the recipes that tried to lighten it. No one seemed to really appreciate the dish.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (8 ounce) box elbow macaroni</li>
            <li>¼ cup butter</li>
            <li>¼ cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>2 cups milk</li>
            <li>2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
           <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook elbow macaroni in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, 8 minutes.</li> 
           <li>At the same time, melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat.</li>
           <li>Add flour, salt, and pepper and stir until smooth, about 5 minutes.</li>
           <li>Pour in milk slowly, while stirring continuously. Continue to cook and stir until mixture is smooth and bubbling, about 5 minutes, making sure the milk doesn't burn.</li>
           <li>Add Cheddar cheese and stir until melted, 2 to 4 minutes.</li>
           <li>Drain macaroni and fold into cheese sauce until coated.</li>
           <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
